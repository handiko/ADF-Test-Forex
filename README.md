# Multi-Pair Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
Perform ADF-Test (stationarity test) on several forex pairs at once and rank the results from the most mean-reversion tendency to least

## Testing a Currency Pair for Stationarity
Let's imagine you have a historical time series of daily closing prices for EUR/USD (EURUSD=X), and you want to test it for stationarity.

1. Run the Test: You would use a function like adfuller() in Python, feeding it your time series data. The function will run the underlying regression and give you the key outputs: the ADF statistic, the p-value, and critical values at various significance levels.
   
2. Hypotheses:
* Null Hypothesis (H0â€‹): The EUR/USD price series has a unit root (is non-stationary). ðŸ˜¥
* Alternative Hypothesis (H1â€‹): The EUR/USD price series does not have a unit root (is stationary). ðŸ¥³

3. Example Output: Let's say the ADF test on your data produces the following results:
* ADF Statistic: -3.25
* p-value: 0.017
* Critical Values:
  * 1% level: -3.45
  * 5% level: -2.87
  * 10% level: -2.57

## Interpreting the Results
Now you must interpret these numbers to make a decision about the time series. There are two primary ways to interpret the results, and they should always lead to the same conclusion.
1. Interpreting the p-value
The p-value is the most common way to interpret the test. You compare it to a pre-determined significance level, typically 0.05.
* Rule: If the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, you reject the null hypothesis.
* Interpretation: In our example, the p-value of 0.017 is less than 0.05. This means we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the EUR/USD time series is stationary. This suggests that prices tend to revert to a mean, making it a good candidate for a mean reversion strategy.

2. Interpreting the ADF Statistic and Critical Values
The ADF statistic itself is a negative number. The more negative it is, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. You compare this statistic to the critical values.
* Rule: If the ADF statistic is more negative than the critical value, you reject the null hypothesis.
* Interpretation: In our example, the ADF statistic of -3.25 is more negative than the 5% critical value of -2.87. This leads us to the same conclusion: we can reject the null hypothesis and confirm that the time series is stationary.

What the Results Mean for Your Trading
* Stationary Series (Reject H0â€‹): This time series is likely to fluctuate around a long-term average. It is a good candidate for a mean reversion strategy. For example, you could sell when the price is far above its moving average and buy when it's far below.
* Non-Stationary Series (Fail to Reject H0â€‹): This time series likely follows a random walk, with no tendency to revert to a mean. It is a good candidate for a trend following strategy, as prices are more likely to continue in their current direction than reverse.

By using the ADF test, you're moving from a subjective "this pair looks like it's ranging" to an objective, data-driven "this pair's statistical properties indicate it's suitable for mean reversion."
